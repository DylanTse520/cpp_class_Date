# cpp_homework:a_class_for_dates
This is my cpp homework, mainly focus on overriding the operator - and +.
The operator - calculates the days between two dates. I wrote this into several sub-functions as dates in the same month, dates in the same year and dates in different years.
The operator + calculates the date that is several days after a date. I also wrote this into several sub-functions.
There are other functions for validating dates, checking leap years, calculating days to the end of a month or a year, calculating days to the beginning of a year, written in the Date.cpp file.
I will write some comments to the codes later.
